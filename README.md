**This is a simple blockchain Project!**

***steps to follow:***

***1. Create a Block Class:***

Define a Block class representing individual blocks in the blockchain.
Include fields like index, timestamp, data, previousHash, hash, etc.
Implement a method to calculate the block's hash (usually using cryptographic hashing algorithms like SHA-256).

***2. Implement Blockchain Class:***

Create a Blockchain class to manage the blocks.
Start by creating the genesis block (the initial block in the chain).
Implement methods to add blocks to the chain, validate the chain’s integrity (by checking hashes), and retrieve the latest block.

***3. Block Mining:***

Implement a basic proof-of-work algorithm for block mining.
Include a mining method that iterates until a valid hash meeting certain criteria (e.g., a specific number of leading zeros) is found.

***4. Test Your Blockchain:***

Create a simple test or main class to instantiate your blockchain.
Add a few blocks with sample data to the chain.
Validate the chain’s integrity by checking if the hashes are consistent.
